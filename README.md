# 30.-Dutch-Auction-and-English-Auction-Web-Application-Game

A Kahoot-style inspired web application live mini-game for a school presentation on the topic of Auctions for a microeconomics module I took during my university. 

It allows multiple users to join a game created by the host, who can act as bidders for an Dutch and English Auction.

(Add rules of the game here and the full microeconomics presentation slides here)

As well as how to run locally or via the deployed platform? What platform did I use to deploy it?


This is just a prototype that I quickly made with the help of ChatGPT. Its not the most robust code. The video demonstrates how its supposed to work.
