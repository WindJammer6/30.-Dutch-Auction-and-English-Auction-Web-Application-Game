# 30.-Dutch-Auction-and-English-Auction-Web-Application-Game
This is a [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/)-style inspired web application live mini-game for a presentation on the topic of Auctions for a microeconomics module I took during my university. It simulates a live auction game that I did with my classmates during the presentation to demonstrate how the generic Dutch Auctions and English Auctions works. 

Here is the link of the deployed 2D Unity game on [Render](https://render.com/): https://three0-dutch-auction-and-english-auction.onrender.com/ (Click the link to try out the game!)

Here is a demonstration of how this game works:  
(add video here)

These videos are done by me, using [OBS Studio software](https://obsproject.com/) for screen recording and VideoPad Video Editor (by NCH Software) for video editing.

Disclaimer: This is just a semi-functioning prototype that I quickly made with the help of ChatGPT. Made in 2 days. Its not the most robust code. The video demonstrates how its supposed to work. Its a very loose peice of code (not robust at all!) so if you dont use according to how it is meant to be used you definitely will get bugs!

Made with socket.io and node.js, html, css and js.

### Features
For this prototype web application, as I was pressed for time, and that it was not graded to build an entire web application for some presentation demonstration (I did it out of interest), it is more focused on implementing the features to demonstrate the concepts of the generic Dutch Auctions and English Auctions in a fun way (it does not have the best code quality nor UI/UX☹️). Here is a list of features in the Dutch Auction and English Auction Web Application game:  
- Main menu
- Host a Dutch Auction page (for hosting a Dutch Auction game)
  - The Dutch Auction page shows who are the players who has joined your game
- Host an English Auction page (for hosting an English Auction game)
  - The English Auction page shows who are the players who has joined your game
- Join a Dutch Auction page (for joining a Dutch Auction game)
- Join a Dutch Auction page (for joining an English Auction game)

It supports multiple game hostings, each of which can be created by creating a game code for that hosting. It also supports multiple players in a game hosting, which they can join by entering the game code of the game they want to join. Just like how [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/) works!
