# 30.-Dutch-Auction-and-English-Auction-Web-Application-Game

A Kahoot-style inspired web application live mini-game for a school presentation on the topic of Auctions for a microeconomics module I took during my university. 

It allows multiple users to join a game created by the host, who can act as bidders for an Dutch and English Auction.
